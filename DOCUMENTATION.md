## Installation

Unzip the download and place the `CookieNotice` directory in your `site/addons` directory.
Then add the `{{ cookie_notice }}` tag at the bottom of your layouts.

## Settings

### Notice Text
If you want to use some custom text for your notice, you can do so by entering it into the addon settings page.

## Button Label
If you want to customise the label of the consent button, this is also possible.

### Location
If you want to change the position of the cookie notice, you can choose from either the bottom or the top of the screen.

### Cookie Name
You can change the name of the cookie that is used by Cookie Notice. By default, it's `cookie_notice` but you can change that to whatever you want.

### Disable Styles
If you would prefer to use your own styles instead of ours, toggle the `Disable Styles` setting.
